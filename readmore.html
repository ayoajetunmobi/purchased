    <p>Mobile Web Browsers Take a moment to review the various mobile browsers and their respective communities. As developers, we must try to embrace all platforms and develop applications that span all of the following browsers—and more if needed. For
        example, your users should not be limited to a WebKit-only mobile application in which your code runs on iOS and Android only. WebKit WebKit is the browser engine behind Mobile Safari, Android, and Chrome, to name a few. This open source project
        is constantly pushing the open web envelope,

        powers many of the leading mobile platform browsers. Figure 2-1 shows the source code revision (vertical) as the function of time (horizontal). Some icons are there to represent products associated with WebKit; the position ap‐ proximately resembles

        been an obvious force in pushing the Web forward. With standard hardware and multicore technology, iPhones and iPads have been a great platform for HTML5 development. But, it’s not all ponies and rainbows in iOS land, as each mobile browser has
        its share of quirks and bugs. Earlier iOS versions suffered from a bug with JavaScript’s innerHTML() and forced developers to think of new ways to insert dynamic content. You’ll see the solution to this problem in the next chapter—as for now,
